# Monolitt

Open-source, multi-purpose workspace that works from the terminal.

## Why?

Monolitt started out of the idea of creating a collaborative tool that provides the same level of abstraction as some productivity and management tools, with the ability of sharing your work with a team, without leaving the terminal.
